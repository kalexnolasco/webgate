# Changelog

## v0.1.1 (2026-04-08)

### Features

- **Per-server SSH/SFTP toggles** -- admin can enable or disable SSH terminal and SFTP file browser independently for each server
- **SFTP path restrictions** -- admin can configure allowed directory paths per server; users are restricted to only those directories and their subdirectories (empty list = unrestricted)

### Details

- New server model fields: `ssh_enabled` (bool), `sftp_enabled` (bool), `sftp_allowed_paths` (JSON list of paths)
- SSH disabled servers return WebSocket close code 4003
- SFTP disabled servers return HTTP 403
- Path restriction enforced on all SFTP operations (ls, read, write, upload, download, mkdir, rename, delete, chmod)
- Rename operations validate both source and destination paths against allowed paths
- All existing tests continue to pass (34 tests)
