# Changelog

## v0.2.1 (2026-04-15)

### Features

- **Reverse proxy sub-path support** -- webgate can now be served behind a reverse proxy at a URL prefix (e.g. `https://example.com/webgate/`). Previously the frontend used absolute `/api/...` paths that broke under any prefix.

### Details

- New config setting: `WEBGATE_ROOT_PATH` (default `""`), passed to FastAPI's `root_path` for correct OpenAPI URLs behind proxies
- Frontend derives the path prefix at runtime from `window.location.pathname` and prepends it to all REST calls and the terminal WebSocket URL
- README documents nginx, Apache, and Traefik reverse-proxy configurations for sub-path deployments
- The proxy must forward the prefix unchanged (do not strip it) -- webgate handles the prefix natively

## v0.2.0 (2026-04-09)

### Features

- **SFTP read-only mode** -- per-server flag to allow browse and download only, blocking all write operations (upload, write, mkdir, rename, delete, chmod)
- **Server status monitoring** -- background task checks SSH connectivity every 60 seconds; online/offline indicator (green/red dot) on server dashboard
- **Dark/light theme toggle** -- user preference saved in localStorage; CSS custom properties for full theme support; terminal and editor adapt to theme
- **Keyboard shortcuts** -- Escape closes modals, Ctrl+1 goes to Site Manager, Ctrl+N opens New Server
- **Drag & drop upload progress** -- visual progress bar with percentage during file uploads
- **Folder download as ZIP** -- right-click a directory in SFTP browser to download it as a ZIP archive
- **Lightweight DB migrations** -- automatic ALTER TABLE for new columns on existing databases

### Details

- New server model field: `sftp_read_only` (bool, default false)
- New file: `servers/monitor.py` — ServerMonitor class with asyncio background task
- New API endpoints: `GET /api/servers/status`, `GET /api/servers/{id}/status`
- New API endpoint: `GET /api/files/{id}/download-zip?path=`
- Config settings: `monitor_interval`, `monitor_timeout`, `monitor_concurrency`
- CSS variables for theming: `--bg-primary`, `--text-primary`, `--accent`, etc.
- Terminal theme switches between dark (Tokyo Night) and light on toggle

## v0.1.1 (2026-04-08)

### Features

- **Per-server SSH/SFTP toggles** -- admin can enable or disable SSH terminal and SFTP file browser independently for each server
- **SFTP path restrictions** -- admin can configure allowed directory paths per server; users are restricted to only those directories and their subdirectories (empty list = unrestricted)

### Details

- New server model fields: `ssh_enabled` (bool), `sftp_enabled` (bool), `sftp_allowed_paths` (JSON list of paths)
- SSH disabled servers return WebSocket close code 4003
- SFTP disabled servers return HTTP 403
- Path restriction enforced on all SFTP operations (ls, read, write, upload, download, mkdir, rename, delete, chmod)
- Rename operations validate both source and destination paths against allowed paths
- All existing tests continue to pass (34 tests)
